## Emotional Regulation in Autism

**Emotional regulation** is the ability to manage intense emotions such as stress, anxiety, frustration, or sensory overwhelm. Many autistic individuals face unique challenges in this area, and may use personal coping strategies.

## Signs of Emotional Dysregulation

Signs that an autistic person may be dysregulated include:

- Increased stimming (e.g., rocking, flapping, pacing)
- Verbal or physical outbursts
- Withdrawal, going mute, or becoming unusually quiet
- Rigid behaviors or distress during transitions
- Intense emotional responses to small triggers

Note: Behaviors vary widely and depend on the individual, environment, and situation.

## Sensory Seeking vs. Sensory Avoidant Coping

Autistic individuals may self-regulate in different ways:

- **Sensory seekers** may seek intense input (e.g., fidgeting, making loud noises)
- **Sensory avoiders** may withdraw from noise, light, or smells

The same person might be sensory-seeking in one situation and sensory-avoidant in another.

## Understanding Context to Support Regulation

Support involves:

- Observing the environment: Is it new or overstimulating?
- Watching for behavioral changes
- Listening (if possible) to how the individual feels
- Avoiding assumptions; instead, providing calm, safe support

## Teaching Emotional Regulation Skills

Before learning self-regulation, autistic children need:

- **Emotion recognition**: Identifying emotions like happy, sad, anxious
- **Understanding emotions**: What triggers each emotion?
- **Awareness of physical signs**: Noticing body signals like tight muscles or fast breathing

These skills can be taught through:

- Modeling (parents labeling their own emotions)
- Visual aids (emotion charts)
- Support from teachers, therapists, and care teams

## What Self-Soothing Can Look Like

Self-soothing behaviors may include:

- Stimming (e.g., rocking, flapping)
- Talking to oneself
- Sitting in a quiet space
- Going for a walk or run
- Deep breathing or other calming routines

These behaviors are normal and often helpful. They should not be discouraged unless harmful.

## Supporting Autistic People During Dysregulation

Community members and caregivers can support by:

- Not interrupting or judging self-regulation behaviors
- Avoiding excessive questions or pressure
- Providing a calm, accepting space
- Acknowledging that everyone needs different ways to self-regulate

Understanding reduces stigma and increases inclusion.

## What Is Emotion Dysregulation?

**Emotion dysregulation** refers to difficulty managing emotional responses. In autism:

- It’s **not a diagnosis**, but a common challenge
- It can lead to behaviors like meltdowns, aggression, or withdrawal
- It may contribute to co-occurring issues like **anxiety** or **depression**

Children with autism are **4x more likely** to struggle with emotion regulation than their neurotypical peers.

## Real-Life Impacts

Emotion regulation difficulties may:

- Interfere with school, friendships, or daily tasks
- Cause exhaustion, especially in teens and adults
- Lead to frustration in families and caregivers

Example: A child might excel at sports or acting, yet be unable to attend school due to emotional challenges.

## Why Emotions Are Harder in Autism

Several reasons:

- Difficulty identifying or naming emotions (sometimes due to **alexithymia**)  
- Feeling emotions **more intensely** than others  
- Sensory sensitivities or poor sleep increasing stress  
- Social rejection or misunderstandings  
- Rigid environments that don’t accommodate neurodiversity

---

## Promising Therapies

Therapies targeting emotion regulation include:

- **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)** – teaches emotional thinking strategies
- **Mindfulness techniques** – build awareness and calm responses
- **Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement (EASE)** – developed specifically for autism
- **Body awareness strategies** – teaching individuals to spot physical signs of emotional escalation

Therapies can be personalized based on the individual's age, verbal ability, and sensory profile.

## Coping Strategy Examples

Examples of coping techniques taught in therapy:

- Going to a quiet place with a toy or calming object  
- Taking deep breaths or drinking water  
- Saying calming phrases: "I can finish it later," "This is OK"  
- Distraction techniques to manage triggers

Parents can reinforce these strategies by **modeling calm behavior** and labeling their own emotional processes.

## Key Insight

Teaching emotion regulation in autism is not about stopping outbursts, but:

- **Building emotional literacy**  
- **Creating safe, accepting environments**  
- **Offering flexible coping tools**  
- **Understanding behavior as communication**

Support, not punishment, leads to emotional growth.
