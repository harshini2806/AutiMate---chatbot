# Executive Function in Autism

Executive function refers to the set of mental skills that help us plan, organize, start, and complete tasks. Many autistic individuals experience challenges with executive function, which can impact learning, work, and daily living.

These difficulties are **neurological**, not due to laziness or lack of motivation, and support strategies can make a big difference.

## 1. What Is Executive Function?

Executive functioning includes skills like:

- **Time management** – estimating how long tasks will take and managing deadlines  
- **Task initiation** – starting tasks without undue procrastination  
- **Planning and organization** – breaking down projects and keeping track of steps  
- **Working memory** – holding information in mind while using it  
- **Flexible thinking** – shifting approaches when things change or don't go as expected  
- **Impulse control** – resisting distractions or emotional reactions  
- **Emotional regulation** – managing frustration or stress during tasks

## 2. Executive Function Challenges in Autism

Many autistic people may:

- Forget steps or materials needed to complete assignments  
- Lose track of time or underestimate how long something takes  
- Have difficulty **switching between tasks**  
- Experience frustration when routines change  
- Need support transitioning between activities or environments
