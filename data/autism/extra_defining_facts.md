## Autism Is Not a Disease

Autism is **not a disease**. This distinction matters because:

- Diseases are often seen as something to "cure"  
- Autism is a **neurodevelopmental difference**, not something to fix

üí° The goal is not to eliminate autism, but to help autistic individuals thrive by:
- Supporting their challenges  
- Enhancing their strengths  
- Promoting self-understanding and acceptance

## Autism and Neurodivergence

Autistic people are **neurodivergent**.

- Neurodivergent means a person's brain functions in ways that differ from the typical or expected  
- Neurodivergence isn‚Äôt a defect ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **natural variation** in how people think, learn, and experience the world

Neurodivergent individuals may:
- Excel in specific areas (e.g., memory, pattern recognition)  
- Need support in others (e.g., social interaction, sensory processing)

## Autism Is a Spectrum

Autism is described as a **spectrum** because:

- Each autistic person is unique  
- There is a **wide range** of abilities, traits, and challenges  
- The term "spectrum" reflects **diversity**, not severity

Some autistic individuals may:
- Be nonverbal or require daily support  
- Communicate fluently and live independently  
- Have overlapping diagnoses like ADHD, anxiety, or sensory sensitivities

## Autism Is Often Misunderstood

Historically, autism has been misunderstood and mistreated:

- Early therapies focused on **making autistic children appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù**  
- Some methods were rigid and **emotionally harmful**

Today, there's a shift toward:

- **Respectful, supportive therapies**  
- **Skill-building** instead of conformity  
- **Celebrating individuality**, not erasing it

But myths still exist, and it takes time to replace them with accurate understanding.
