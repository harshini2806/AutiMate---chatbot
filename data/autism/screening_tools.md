Autism Screening Tools
## M-CHAT-R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers – Revised with Follow-Up)
Age Group: 16–30 months
Used By: Pediatricians and caregivers
Purpose: Early screening tool to identify children at risk for ASD
Format: 20 yes/no questions completed by a caregiver
Follow-Up: Additional questions if the child scores in the moderate-risk range
What It Screens For: Lack of pointing, eye contact, response to name, and joint attention
Outcome: Low, medium, or high risk → may trigger referral for further diagnostic evaluation
Advantages: Quick, easy to use, parent-friendly
Limitations: Not diagnostic; false positives/negatives are possible

## ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition)
Age Group: 12 months to adulthood
Used By: Trained clinicians only
Purpose: Gold standard diagnostic tool for observing communication, social interaction, play, and repetitive behaviors
Format: Semi-structured, face-to-face activities and prompts in 5 modules (based on language level and age)
What It Evaluates: Natural behaviors such as eye contact, conversation ability, imaginative play
Outcome: Helps confirm or rule out an autism diagnosis
Advantages: Highly validated and widely used in clinics and research
Limitations: Requires training and certification; not self-administered

## CARS-2 (Childhood Autism Rating Scale, 2nd Edition)
Age Group: 2 years and up
Used By: Clinicians, educators, psychologists
Purpose: Rate severity of autism symptoms
Format: Observation and caregiver interview across 15 domains (e.g., emotional response, body use, adaptation to change)
Scoring: Each item rated on a 4-point scale → total score places child into Non-Autistic, Mild-Moderate ASD, or Severe ASD
Advantages: Measures symptom intensity; usable in different settings
Limitations: Less comprehensive than ADOS for diagnosis

## SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire)
Age Group: 4+ years (mental age ≥2 years)
Used By: Parents or caregivers
Purpose: Screens for social communication difficulties related to ASD
Format: 40 yes/no questions based on ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised)
Use: Commonly used in schools and clinical intake settings
Advantages: Easy to administer, good for large-scale screening
Limitations: Cannot measure severity; relies on caregiver accuracy

## STAT (Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children)
Age Group: 24–36 months
Used By: Trained professionals
Purpose: Play-based screening for ASD through structured activities
Format: 12 interactive tasks focusing on play, imitation, and social engagement
Outcome: Score helps decide if further evaluation is needed
Advantages: Fun and non-invasive; ideal for early intervention settings
Limitations: Requires training; takes more time than checklists
