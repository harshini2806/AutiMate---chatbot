# Masking and Camouflaging in Autism

Masking (also called camouflaging) refers to the conscious or unconscious suppression of autistic traits to fit in or avoid negative attention. Many autistic individuals learn to "mask" their natural behaviors, especially in social situations.

## 1. What Is Masking?

Masking can include:

- Forcing eye contact even if it feels unnatural  
- Suppressing stimming behaviors (like hand-flapping or rocking)  
- Copying others' facial expressions, tone, or speech patterns  
- Preparing and rehearsing social scripts in advance  
- Hiding sensory sensitivities (e.g., enduring loud noises)  
- Pretending to understand jokes or social cues

It often begins in **childhood** and becomes more complex with age.

## 2. Why Do People Mask?

Autistic people may mask in order to:

- Avoid **bullying, teasing, or exclusion**  
- Fit in with peers at school or work  
- Meet societal or cultural expectations  
- Avoid being perceived as “weird” or “difficult”  
- Pass as neurotypical in professional or social settings

Masking is often a **learned survival strategy**, not a choice.

## 3. Impact on Mental Health

While masking can help people **navigate social situations**, it often comes at a personal cost:

- **Exhaustion and burnout**  
- **Anxiety and depression**  
- **Loss of identity** or disconnection from true self  
- **Delayed diagnosis**, especially in adults  
- Feeling like one is "always acting" or “wearing a mask”  
- May struggle to maintain relationships due to internal fatigue

Prolonged masking is strongly linked to **autistic burnout**, which involves emotional exhaustion, sensory overload, and a drop in functioning.

## 4. Masking in Women and Marginalized Groups

- Masking is **more common in autistic women and girls**, contributing to underdiagnosis  
- Girls may be more socially motivated and better at copying behaviors  
- **Trans, nonbinary, and BIPOC autistic people** may mask to stay safe in different cultural or social settings  
- These patterns can hide the presence of autism during assessments, leading to misdiagnosis or late diagnosis

## 5. Unmasking and Support

Unmasking is the process of:

- Identifying what behaviors are genuine vs. performed  
- Finding **safe spaces** to be authentically autistic  
- Engaging in **self-acceptance** and setting boundaries  
- Using accommodations instead of pushing through discomfort

Support strategies:

- Allow safe stimming and breaks  
- Normalize alternative communication or interaction styles  
- Encourage environments that reduce pressure to conform  
- Offer therapy that focuses on identity-building, not "fixing" behavior

## 6. Final Notes

Masking is often invisible to others—but its emotional impact is profound. Recognizing, understanding, and validating the experience of masking is crucial to the mental well-being of autistic individuals.

It's okay to need rest.
It's okay to stim.
It's okay to be yourself.
