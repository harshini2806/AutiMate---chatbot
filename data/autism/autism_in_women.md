## Autism in Females: Overview

Although traditionally believed to be more common in males, recent studies suggest that many autistic females go undiagnosed. Around 80% of autistic females remain undiagnosed by age 18.

A diagnosis in adulthood can offer clarity, explain lifelong symptoms, and provide access to healthcare and support systems.

## Why Autism in Females Goes Undiagnosed

Unlike physical conditions, autism has no medical test. Diagnosis is based on:

- Developmental history  
- Behavioral observation  
- Assessments of social and repetitive behavior patterns

Historically, autism has been researched and defined through a male lens. As a result:

- Diagnostic tools are biased toward male traits  
- Boys are referred for evaluation far more often than girls  
- Physicians often miss signs in females if traits don't align with "typical" autism profiles

## How Autism Looks Different in Females

Autistic traits in girls can be subtler and more socially acceptable, making them harder to detect:

- **Fewer visible social difficulties**: Girls may participate more in conversations and appear socially engaged  
- **Internalized symptoms**: Girls may show anxiety or depression instead of external behaviors like hyperactivity  
- **More typical interests**: Intense interests (e.g., horses or celebrities) might align with neurotypical female interests and be overlooked

This difference often leads to missed diagnoses during childhood.

## Masking in Autistic Females

**Masking** refers to the act of hiding or compensating for autistic traits in order to fit in socially.

Common masking behaviors include:

- Copying facial expressions and tone from others  
- Rehearsing social interactions  
- Mimicking characters from TV or movies

While masking helps autistic females appear more socially typical, it often results in:

- Mental fatigue  
- High stress  
- Increased anxiety or depression

Because of masking, autistic females without cognitive or behavioral impairments are often diagnosed much later in life.

## Developmental Differences Over Time

While autistic girls may show stronger social and communication abilities during childhood, studies suggest:

- These strengths may decline over time  
- In adolescence and adulthood, social difficulties often increase  
- Adult autistic females may face more challenges than males in emotional regulation and relationship management

The long-term developmental course of autism in females remains under-researched.
