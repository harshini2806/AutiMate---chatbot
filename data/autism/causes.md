## Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

The exact causes of autism are not fully known. However, research suggests that a combination of **genetic** and **environmental factors** influence brain development and increase the likelihood of ASD.

## Genetic Risk Factors for ASD

Some genetic conditions and family traits may raise the risk of ASD:

- Having a sibling with ASD  
- Having older parents  
- Having certain genetic conditions (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome)  
- Having a very low birth weight

Not everyone with these factors will develop autism.

## Vaccines and Autism: What Science Says

Extensive scientific research has **found no link** between vaccines and autism:

- The **MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)** vaccine does **not** cause autism.  
- Studies suggesting a connection were flawed or biased.  
- Other childhood vaccines also **do not** increase autism risk.  
- Ingredients like **thiomersal** and **aluminium** in vaccines have been proven **safe**.

---

## Environmental Risk Factors: Air Pollution

Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy may increase ASD risk:

- Living near a **freeway** during the third trimester is associated with higher autism rates.  
- A **gene-environment interaction**: Children with mutations in the **MET gene** and high pollution exposure had higher autism risk.

## Prenatal & Maternal Factors

Certain health conditions during pregnancy are linked with autism:

- **Maternal immune system issues** or inflammation  
- **Maternal diabetes** or **obesity**  
- **Fever** during pregnancy  
- Maternal **autoantibodies** that may interfere with brain development

## Heavy Metals and Toxic Exposure

Some studies suggest links between ASD and exposure to:

- **Lead, mercury, arsenic**  
- Disrupted levels of **zinc**, **copper**, or **manganese**  
- **Pesticides** like DDT  
- Environmental chemicals: **Bisphenol A**, **phthalates**, **flame retardants**, **PCBs**

Note: Studies show mercury levels in children with autism are not significantly different from those without autism, especially when dietary sources are considered.

---

## Twin Studies on Metal Imbalance

Research using baby teeth from twins showed:

- Autistic children had **higher lead** and **lower manganese/zinc** levels  
- Disrupted **zinc-copper cycles** were observed in children with ASD  
- These imbalances may affect brain development during sensitive periods

---

## Prenatal Vitamins & Nutritional Protection

Nutrition during pregnancy may lower autism risk:

- **Prenatal vitamins** (especially before and during early pregnancy) are protective  
- **Folic acid** may help prevent autism, especially in genetically susceptible individuals  
- Multivitamins may reduce risk of autism and intellectual disability  
- Folic acid may lessen the harmful impact of **air pollution** and **pesticides**

Women who took folic acid in the **first month of pregnancy** had lower rates of children diagnosed with ASD.

---

## Summary

ASD is influenced by multiple risk factors, including:

- **Genetic traits**  
- **Environmental exposure** (pollution, metals)  
- **Maternal health**  
- **Nutritional intake** (e.g., folic acid)

Vaccines are **not** a cause of autism, according to large-scale, peer-reviewed studies.
