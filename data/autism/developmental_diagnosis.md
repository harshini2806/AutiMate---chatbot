## Developmental Monitoring

**Developmental monitoring** is the ongoing process of observing a child's growth and encouraging conversations between caregivers and healthcare providers.

It involves watching how a child:

- Plays  
- Learns  
- Speaks  
- Behaves  
- Moves

During well-child visits, doctors or nurses may ask questions, observe the child, or play with them to assess if milestones are being met.

üìå Be sure to mention any family history of conditions like:
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  
- Learning disorders  
- Intellectual disability  
- ADHD

## What Is Developmental Screening?

**Developmental screening** is a more formal method of checking how a child is developing. It may involve questionnaires, checklists, or observation by a professional.

Even if there are no concerns, screening is recommended as part of routine care.

### AAP Screening Recommendations:
- **Developmental/behavioral screening** at: 9 months, 18 months, and 30 months  
- **Autism-specific screening** at: 18 months and 24 months

## Screening Tools and Process

Screening compares a child's skills to those of typically developing children of the same age. Tools may assess:

- Language and speech  
- Movement and motor skills  
- Problem-solving and thinking  
- Emotional and behavioral traits

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Screenings can be done by:
- Doctors or nurses  
- Community health workers  
- School or daycare staff

Parents may be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Screening should also be done if:
- A concern is raised at any age  
- The child has a higher risk (e.g. sibling with ASD)  
- ASD-related behaviors are noticed

You can request a screening even if it‚Äôs not routinely offered.

## Developmental Diagnosis

A **developmental diagnosis** is made when a child undergoes a more in-depth evaluation, usually after a screening indicates concern.

This is done by trained specialists such as:

- Developmental pediatricians  
- Child psychologists  
- Speech-language pathologists  
- Occupational therapists

üß† The evaluation may include:
- Structured tests  
- Direct observation  
- Caregiver interviews or questionnaires

## Why Early Diagnosis Matters

Diagnosing ASD early allows children to:

- Access early intervention services  
- Get tailored supports for their challenges  
- Reach their full potential in learning and development

A brief screening does **not** provide a diagnosis, but it can flag potential delays that require further evaluation.

In some cases, specialists may also recommend **genetic testing** or counseling.

## Summary

- **Monitoring** is informal and ongoing  
- **Screening** is structured and compares development to age-based norms  
- **Diagnosis** requires a formal evaluation by specialists  
- Early detection and support can greatly improve outcomes for children with ASD
