# Autism Burnout / Autistic Fatigue

Autistic burnout—also called autistic fatigue—is a state of physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion that many autistic people experience after prolonged stress, sensory overload, masking, or social demands. It can significantly reduce day-to-day functioning and well-being.

## 1. What Is Autism Burnout?

Autism burnout is **not the same as typical tiredness**. It is a deeper form of exhaustion related to long-term coping with sensory, emotional, cognitive, or social stress—often without enough support or recovery time.

Burnout may appear suddenly or build up over time and can lead to a noticeable drop in skills, energy, or ability to function.

- Lack of rest or unstructured downtime

## 6. Final Thoughts

Autistic burnout is a serious and often misunderstood experience. It’s not weakness—it’s a sign your needs have been ignored or unmet for too long.

Recovery means **slowing down**, **setting boundaries**, and **honoring your brain**.

You don’t have to earn rest.
You deserve support.
You are not alone.
