## Core Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Autism Spectrum Disorder includes two major categories of symptoms:

1. **Social communication and interaction difficulties**
2. **Restricted or repetitive behaviors, interests, or sensory patterns**

Most individuals with autism show signs in both areas.
