## Overview: Comorbid Conditions in Autism

Autistic individuals often experience physical and mental health conditions alongside autism. These are known as **comorbidities** and may appear at different developmental stages. They are important for all healthcare providers to understand.

Common comorbidities include:

- Epilepsy or seizure disorders  
- Sleep disorders  
- ADHD  
- Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  
- Feeding and eating challenges  
- Obesity  
- Anxiety  
- Depression  
- Bipolar disorder

Many people with ASD have difficulty communicating discomfort, which can lead to behavioral symptoms such as irritability, self-injury, or aggression.

## Epilepsy and Seizures

- Affects **25‚Äì40%** of people with ASD (vs. 2‚Äì3% of general population)  
- Risk is higher with intellectual disability, family history of epilepsy, or neurological issues

**Symptoms to watch for:**
- Staring spells  
- Muscle stiffening or jerking  
- Sudden sleepiness or behavioral regression  
- Sudden aggression or irritability

üìå If epilepsy is suspected, refer to a **neurologist familiar with autism-friendly EEG protocols**.

## Gastrointestinal (GI) Disorders

GI issues affect up to **85%** of autistic individuals. Common problems include:

- Diarrhea  
- Constipation  
- Gas and bloating  
- Painful bowel movements  
- GERD (acid reflux)

**Behavioral signs of GI discomfort:**
- Arching back  
- Gritting teeth  
- Pressing belly  
- Neck straining or throat tapping  
- Refusing food or avoiding lying down

üö´ Note: While some families report improvement with gluten-free diets, research does **not support** it as an autism-specific intervention.

## Feeding and Eating Challenges

Autistic children often have **restricted eating** or **food selectivity** due to:

- Sensory sensitivities  
- Anxiety  
- Medication side effects  
- Low physical activity or social isolation

üìä **30% of autistic children are obese**, compared to 13% in the general population. Obesity should be addressed in pediatric care planning.

## Sleep Disorders

**Sleep disturbance affects 50‚Äì80%** of autistic children.

Common issues:
- Trouble falling asleep  
- Night wakings  
- Early morning waking

Sleep issues can worsen daytime behaviors and reduce family quality of life.

üîß Interventions:
- Sleep hygiene routines  
- Parent-guided sleep training programs  
- In severe cases, referral to a sleep specialist

## Psychiatric Comorbidities

Up to **85%** of autistic children have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis.  
üìå **35%** are prescribed at least one psychotropic medication.

Most common conditions:
- **ADHD**  
- **Anxiety**  
- **Depression**  
- **Bipolar disorder** (less common but important)

üîç Watch for anxiety and depression especially in **older children**, as self-awareness increases.

## ADHD vs ASD: Diagnostic Challenge

ADHD symptoms often overlap with ASD, including:

- Inattention  
- Hyperactivity  
- Repetitive behavior  
- Poor eye contact

üí° Even experienced clinicians may find it hard to separate them. Collaboration between parents, pediatricians, and ASD specialists is important to tailor effective treatment ‚Äî including possible medication.

## Summary

Comorbid conditions in ASD are common and can significantly impact:

- Physical health  
- Emotional well-being  
- Behavior  
- Quality of life

Proper screening, diagnosis, and coordinated care are essential for effective management.
