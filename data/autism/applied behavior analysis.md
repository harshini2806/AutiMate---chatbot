## Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy based on the science of learning and behavior. It helps us understand:

- How behavior works  
- How behavior is affected by the environment  
- How learning occurs

ABA applies this understanding to real-life situations to increase helpful behaviors and reduce harmful or disruptive ones.

## Goals of ABA Therapy

ABA therapy aims to:

- Increase language and communication skills  
- Improve attention, focus, memory, academics, and social skills  
- Reduce problem behaviors

It has been used successfully with children with autism since the 1960s and is tailored to each individual's needs.

## How ABA Works

ABA is flexible and can be:

- Delivered at home, school, or in the community  
- One-on-one or in group settings  
- Adapted to suit different individuals and goals  
- Focused on daily life and functional outcomes

## Key Technique: Positive Reinforcement

One of the main strategies in ABA is **positive reinforcement**.

- A behavior followed by a valued reward is more likely to be repeated  
- Reinforcers might include praise, toys, books, videos, or preferred activities  
- This helps the individual learn and repeat helpful behaviors over time

Example:  
If a child shares a toy and receives praise or playtime, they’re more likely to share again in the future.

## Understanding Behavior: The A-B-C Model

ABA also uses the **Antecedent–Behavior–Consequence (ABC)** approach to understand and shape behavior.

1. **Antecedent** – What happens before a behavior (e.g., a request or stimulus)
2. **Behavior** – The action or response that follows
3. **Consequence** – What happens after the behavior (e.g., a reward or no response)

This helps analyze and modify behavior patterns.

Example:  
- **Antecedent**: Teacher says, “Time to clean up your toys.”  
- **Behavior**: Student yells, “No!”  
- **Consequence**: Teacher removes toys and says, “Okay, toys are all done.”

This feedback loop helps determine why a behavior occurs and how consequences affect it.

## Summary

ABA is an evidence-based, adaptable therapy for teaching skills and reducing challenging behaviors in autistic individuals. Key tools include:

- Individualized goals  
- Positive reinforcement  
- ABC analysis of behavior
